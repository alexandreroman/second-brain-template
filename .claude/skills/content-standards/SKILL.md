# Content Standards

## Encoding

All generated files MUST use UTF-8 encoding.

## Language

ALWAYS use English when creating content.

## Typography

NEVER use the em dash character (—) in generated text. Replace it with a contextual equivalent (commas, colons, or parentheses) depending on the sentence structure. NEVER use a simple dash (-) as a replacement for an em dash.
