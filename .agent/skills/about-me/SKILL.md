# About Me

This skill provides information about the user by reading the profile generated by the `init` skill.

## Workflow

1.  **Check Profile Existence**
    - Check if the file `resources/profile.md` exists.
    - **If the file does NOT exist**: 
        - **STOP ALL CURRENT TASKS IMMEDIATELY**
        - Inform the user that their profile has not been initialized yet
        - Invite the user to run the `init` skill to create their profile
        - Do NOT proceed with any other tasks until the profile is created
        - Example message: "⚠️ Your profile doesn't exist yet. Please run the `init` skill first to set up your profile before using other skills."
    - **If the file exists**: Proceed to the next step.

2.  **Read User Profile**
    - Read the content of `resources/profile.md`.
    - This file contains the user's name, profession, current employer, education, current projects, and interests in English.

3.  **Provide Information**
    - Display the user's profile information in a clear, formatted way
    - This information can be used to personalize other skills (like `review`) or to answer questions about the user
